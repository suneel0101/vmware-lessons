# Conceptual Intro to ML
- What is machine learning?
- Supervised vs unsupervised

## Important Terms
Let's explore these terms through the example of a Netflix-like recommendation service.

- Classification
- Regression
- Features
- Target
- Training set
- Validation set

## Brainstorming
1. Come up with examples of supervised learning in the tech or apps you use in your daily life. Identify what the feature is and the target is in each case. Then we'll share.
2. Do the same for unsupervised learning.

## Models
### Discussion
- What is a model?
- Consider a model as a "blackbox". What are its inputs and outputs?
- Let's go over examples of models

# kNN Theory and Application
## The Theory
- I'll walk you through a scenario and we'll get an intuitive sense of how this algorithm works.

## Worksheets
Let's work through these examples

## Discussion
- What could be the pros/cons of this model?
- How/where might it fail?
- Why are these questions important?

## Practice & Tuning
Let's build a kNN classifier on the [breast cancer data set](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ga-dat-2015-suneel/datasets/breast-cancer.csv)

Let's open up the kNN notebook.

# Random Forest Theory and Application
## Trees
- Why trees?
- Non-linearity....

### Issues
- What could go wrong with trees?
- How can we address this limitation?

## Ensemble methods

## Random Forest
### Intuition & Procedure
- Let's go through the intuition behind random forest
- Then let's get a handle on the exact procedure that this algorithm executes.

### Practice
- Let's practice this model on the breast cancer set
- Tune it using the parameters available
